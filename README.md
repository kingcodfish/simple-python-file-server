# Simple Python File Server

A lightweight, web-based file server built with Flask that allows easy file sharing across a network. It provides a simple interface for uploading, downloading, and managing files and directories.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

This file server is intended for local network use only. It does not include:
- Authentication system
- User permissions
- Access controls
- Encryption

**DO NOT** expose this server to the internet by port forwarding or hosting on a public server.

## Features

- üì§ Upload multiple files (no file type restrictions)
- üì• Download files
- üìÅ Create directories
- üóëÔ∏è Delete files and directories
- üì± Mobile-friendly interface
- üîç Automatic file sorting (directories first)
- üé® Customizable file type icons
- üìä File size and modification date display

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Install Flask:
```bash
pip install flask
```

## Configuration

The following settings can be modified in `fileserver.py`:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Place the `fileserver.py` file outside of your `UPLOAD_FOLDER` directory to prevent it from being accessible or accidentally deleted through the web interface.

```python
# Network Configuration
SERVER_HOST = '0.0.0.0'  # Listen on all available interfaces
SERVER_PORT = 80         # HTTP default port

# Application Settings
APP_TITLE = 'File server - Made by kingcodfish'
UPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/upload/directory'

# File Type Icons Configuration
FILE_ICONS = {
    # Documents
    'pdf': 'üìÑ',
    'txt': 'üìù',
    'doc': 'üìÑ',
    
    # Spreadsheets
    'xls': 'üìä',
    'xlsx': 'üìä',
    
    # Media
    'mp3': 'üéµ',
    'mp4': 'üé•',
    
    # Add your own icons here
}

# Directory icon
DIR_ICON = 'üìÅ'
```

### Customizing File Icons

The file server now supports fully customizable file type icons:

1. **Adding New Icons**
   ```python
   FILE_ICONS = {
       'existing': 'üìÑ',
       'mynewtype': 'üîÆ',  # Add custom file types
       'py': 'üêç'         # Use any emoji or text
   }
   ```

2. **Icon Display Rules**
   - Files with matching extensions show their configured icon
   - Files with unknown extensions show no icon
   - Directories always show the DIR_ICON (üìÅ by default)
   - Icons can be emoji or text characters

3. **Changing Directory Icon**
   ```python
   DIR_ICON = 'üìÇ'  # Change to any icon you prefer
   ```

## Usage

1. Set your desired `UPLOAD_FOLDER` in the configuration
2. Run the server:
```bash
python fileserver.py
```
3. Access the file server through your web browser:
   - Local: `http://localhost`
   - Network: `http://[your-ip-address]`
